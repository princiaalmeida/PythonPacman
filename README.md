# PythonPacman

This project is a recreation of the iconic Pac-Man game, allowing players to navigate a maze, eat pellets, and avoid (or eat!) ghosts. It's built from scratch using Pygame, providing a fun and challenging experience.

## Features

* **Classic Pac-Man Gameplay**: Experience the traditional Pac-Man maze, pellets, power pellets, and ghosts.
* **Four Unique Ghosts**: Encounter Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (blue), and Clyde (orange), each with distinct movement patterns.
* **Power-Up Mechanics**: Eat power pellets to temporarily turn the tables on the ghosts and make them vulnerable.
* **Score Tracking**: Accumulate points by eating pellets and ghosts.
* **Lives System**: Start with multiple lives and lose one upon collision with a regular ghost.
* **Game Over and Win Conditions**: See a "Game Over" screen if you run out of lives or a "Victory!" screen if you clear the maze of all pellets.
* **Dynamic Board Generation**: The game board is defined by a numerical matrix, allowing for easy modification or creation of new levels.

## Game Objectives:

* Eat all the small white dots (pellets) on the board to clear the level.
* Eat the larger white dots (power pellets) to temporarily turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. When ghosts are blue, you can eat them for bonus points!
* Avoid contact with the ghosts when they are in their regular state.
* If you collide with a ghost in its regular state, you lose a life. Lose all lives, and it's game over!
